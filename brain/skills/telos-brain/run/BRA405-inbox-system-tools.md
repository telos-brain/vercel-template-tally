description: The in-brain system tools for operating the learning-signal inbox
  — create_inbox_entry, create_inbox_cluster, list_inbox_entries,
  get_inbox_entry, update_inbox_entry, list_inbox_tasks, add_inbox_task and
  update_inbox_task. All identity is by 8-character reference (never UUID);
  workflows are selected by code. Covers how PENDING tasks auto-run from the
  linked workflow's inbox trigger (see BRA404). For clustering related entries,
  see BRA413 (create_inbox_cluster). For persisting a run quality score, see
  BRA406 (set_run_grading). For listing Organisation members and assigning
  tasks by email, see BRA408 (list_users, assign_task_to_user).

# Inbox System Tools

BRA404 covers the **Execution API** HTTP surface for inbox intake (paths still
use Guids). This skill covers the complementary **AI-facing system tools**: a
running brain creating, listing, reading and updating its own inbox entries and
tasks — no webhook URL or API key.

**Identity rule:** every tool parameter and every list/detail field that
identifies an entry or task uses an **8-character lowercase alphanumeric
reference** (`[a-z0-9]{8}`). Do **not** pass UUIDs. Linked workflows are named by
**`workflow_code`**, not `workflow_id`.

These are ordinary `system` tools (BRA214). Declarations live under
`tools/inbox/` in the brain schema (and sample brains). This skill lists them in
frontmatter `tools:` so a workflow that keeps them under `available-tools` can
promote them via `get_skill` (same pattern as BRA203 / `WF-SKILL-UPDATE`).

**Run grading** (`set_run_grading`) is declared in the same `tools/inbox/` group
but documented in **BRA406** — eval workflows typically call both
`create_inbox_entry` and `set_run_grading` (BRA207).

## The inbox tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key parameters | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`create_inbox_entry`** | Create a learning signal | `title`, `body`, `routing_type`; optional `source`, `status`, `weight`, `workflow_name`, `entity_name`, `unit_of_work_name` | Confirmation with new entry **reference** |
| **`create_inbox_cluster`** | Consolidate related entries | `inbox_entry_references`, `cluster_title`, `cluster_description` | Confirmation with new cluster **reference** (BRA413) |
| **`list_inbox_entries`** | List entries (optional filters) | `status`, `routing_type`, `count` | CSV keyed by `Reference` |
| **`get_inbox_entry`** | Full entry + tasks | `inbox_entry_reference` | Markdown |
| **`update_inbox_entry`** | Status, routing type, title, body, and/or absolute weight | `inbox_entry_reference`, `status`, `routing_type`, `title`, `body`, `weight` | Confirmation |
| **`list_inbox_tasks`** | Tasks for one entry | `inbox_entry_reference` | CSV keyed by `Reference` |
| **`add_inbox_task`** | Create a task | `inbox_entry_reference`, `workflow_code`, `instructions`, optional `assigned_to` | Confirmation with new task reference |
| **`update_inbox_task`** | Status / action; approve | `inbox_task_reference`, `status`, `action` | Confirmation |

Intended flows:

- **Learning evals:** `create_inbox_entry` (once per learning, with source-context
  metadata when available) then `set_run_grading` (BRA406 / BRA207)
- **Triage / review:** list entries → get entry → cluster related signals
  (`create_inbox_cluster`, BRA413) or overwrite title/body → list/add/update tasks

## `create_inbox_entry`

Creates an inbox entry the same way as `POST /inbox`, without an outbound HTTP
call. Prefer this over a declared HTTP tool that `POST`s to a host URL — no
API key, no localhost.

Required: `title`, `body`, `routing_type` (`SKILL_UPDATE`, `WORKFLOW_UPDATE`,
`TOOL_UPDATE`, `MEMORY_UPDATE`, `SYSTEM_CHANGE`, or a brain-defined value).
Optional: `source`, `status`, `weight` (positive integer, default 1), and source-context labels for triage grouping:

| Parameter | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow_name` | Subject workflow **code**. When omitted on a run eval, filled from the subject run |
| `entity_name` | Entity name. When omitted, filled from the subject run (or the eval run's entity) |
| `unit_of_work_name` | Unit-of-work **title**. When omitted, filled from the subject run (or the eval run's unit of work) |
| `weight` | Absolute signal weight. Omit for the default of 1. Stored before stage-1 trigger matching |

On a `workflowrun:complete` eval, omit these three — `create_inbox_entry` copies
them from the run being graded. They are also present on `{{run.telemetry}}`.
Do not invent values.

| `status` | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| omitted / `PENDING` | Stage-1 inbox trigger matching runs (entry `routing_type` + learning mode + weight — BRA404), then the entry auto-promotes to `PROCESSED` |
| `PROCESSED` | Created without firing inbox triggers — preferred for grade-linked findings that should not spawn tasks |

Returns a confirmation including the new entry's **reference**, **Depth**, and
how many triggered tasks were created. Those tasks start `PENDING`; auto-run vs
`AWAITING_APPROVAL` is decided later from each task's linked workflow (BRA404
stage 2).

**Depth** (mirrors `WorkflowRun.RecursionDepth`):

| How the entry is created | Depth |
| --- | --- |
| Management / Execution API, email, Granola, etc. | `1` |
| `create_inbox_entry` from a run **not** linked to an inbox entry | `1` |
| `create_inbox_entry` from a workflow triggered by an inbox entry or task | parent entry `Depth + 1` |

So a top-level inbox signal is depth 1; a learning created by a workflow that
ran from that entry is depth 2; and so on.

Canonical YAML: `tools/inbox/create-inbox-entry.yml`.

---

## `create_inbox_cluster`

Consolidates related inbox entries into one PROCESSED cluster entry. Full
contract, when-to-use guidance, and atomic behaviour: **BRA413**.

Canonical YAML: `tools/inbox/create-inbox-cluster.yml`.

---

## `list_inbox_entries`

Optional filters:

| Parameter | Default / behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | Omit for open entries (`PENDING` and `PROCESSED`). Pass `ALL` for every status, a single status, or a comma-separated list |
| `routing_type` | Optional exact filter |
| `count` | Maximum rows after sort; defaults to `50` when omitted or not a positive integer |

Sorted by **Weight** descending, then **Date** descending. Clustered source
entries (`ClusterId` set) are omitted from the default open list — they have
been absorbed. Returns a count line (`N inbox entries` or
`N inbox entries (showing M)`) then CSV:

`Reference,Date,Title,Source,WorkflowName,EntityName,UnitOfWorkName,Weight`

`Date` is `d MMM yy, HH:mm` (e.g. `1 Jul 26, 09:00`).

Use `get_inbox_entry` for the body.

## `get_inbox_entry`

Requires `inbox_entry_reference`. Returns markdown with entry scalars (including
WorkflowName, EntityName, UnitOfWorkName, Weight, and Cluster as an 8-character
reference), full body, and a task list (each task by **reference**, with
`workflow` as a **code**).

## `update_inbox_entry`

Requires `inbox_entry_reference` and at least one of `status`, `routing_type`,
`title`, `body`, or `weight`. A call that sets only `weight` succeeds. Entry
lifecycle is `PENDING → PROCESSED → COMPLETED`. Terminal `COMPLETED` cannot be
overwritten.

`title` (max 500) and `body` are plain overwrites when supplied. Prepend the
previous body yourself when consolidating history — the tool does not keep a
revision log.

`weight` is an optional absolute positive integer (1 or greater). It is written
to this entry's `Weight` before the tool returns, so a following
`add_inbox_task` reads the new value at stage 2. Omit `weight` to leave the
stored weight unchanged. The confirmation states the weight that was saved.
Cluster weight is the sum of source weights taken when the cluster was created
and is not recalculated here.

## `list_inbox_tasks`

Requires `inbox_entry_reference`. Returns CSV for that entry only:

`Reference,Status,WorkflowCode,Action,Response,CreatedAt,UpdatedAt`

## `add_inbox_task`

Requires `inbox_entry_reference`. Optional `workflow_code` (resolved server-side),
`instructions` (stored as the task action — instructions-only; entry content
reaches triggered workflows via `{{inboxEntry.*}}`, see BRA204), and
`assigned_to` (email of an active Organisation member — same validation as
`assign_task_to_user` in **BRA408**; omit or pass null to leave unassigned).
Creates status `PENDING` and returns the new task's **reference**.

**Auto-run:** the engine decides from the **workflow named by
`workflow_code`**, not from the second-segment routing pattern. If that
workflow has an `inbox:…` trigger whose learning-mode qualifier, optional
weight threshold, and optional fifth-segment routing code are satisfied
(weight / routing are the parent entry's **current** values), the task moves
`PENDING → RUNNING` and runs. Otherwise it moves to `AWAITING_APPROVAL` for
human sign-off. Full rules: **BRA404** (Inbox triggers — two stages). Workflow
`trigger-mode` does not control this path. Apply-learning workflows typically
declare `inbox:*:high:10`; add `:<RoutingType>` to limit auto-run to one
routing code.

To assign an **existing** task, use `assign_task_to_user` (**BRA408**) instead
of recreating it.

## `update_inbox_task`

Requires `inbox_task_reference` and at least one of `status` or `action`.
Forward-only task lifecycle. Setting `status` to `RUNNING` from
`AWAITING_APPROVAL` **approves** the task and runs the linked workflow
synchronously (settles `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`; never left stranded in
`RUNNING`).

## Wiring them into a workflow

1. Include the `tools/inbox/` group in `brain-compose.yml`.
2. Either inject under workflow `tools:`, or list under `available-tools:` and
   load this skill (`BRA405`) via `get_skill` to promote them.

Minimal declaration for create:

```yaml
name: create_inbox_entry
version: 1
description: >-
  Creates a single inbox entry recording one learning signal.
system:
  tool: create_inbox_entry
parameters:
  - name: title
    param: title
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: body
    param: body
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: routing_type
    param: routing_type
    type: string
    required: true
```

## Safety and scope

- **Brain-scoped, always.** The harness injects the brain; it is never a
  parameter. Cross-brain references read as not found.
- **References only.** Agents must copy `Reference` values from list/get /
  create output — never invent Guids.
- **Creating entries** uses the `create_inbox_entry` **system** tool (this
  skill). The Execution API `POST /inbox` (BRA404) remains available for
  external harnesses; eval workflows should prefer the system tool.
