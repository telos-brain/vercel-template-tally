# Execution API: Authentication & Conventions

The Execution API is the runtime surface of a Telos Brain. It is entirely separate from the Management API (the deploy plane used by the CLI) — different middleware, different credentials, different routes.

| | Management API | Execution API |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Provision & configure brains | Run workflows against entities/units of work |
| Auth | Clerk org JWT / `tbk_` org API key | Per-brain API key |
| Tenant scope | Explicit `BrainId` per query | Implicit — resolved from the API key |
| Routes | `/brains/...` | `/brain`, `/entities`, `/units-of-work`, `/workflows`, `/runs`, `/inbox`, `/skills`, `/transcription` |

---

## Authentication

All Execution API endpoints are secured by the **brain API key**, issued once by the Management API when the brain is created. Present it as a bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <brain-api-key>
```

The key resolves to a single active brain, which becomes the implicit tenant scope for the entire request. Every entity, unit of work, workflow, run, and telemetry read/write is scoped to that brain. **No `brain_id` is ever accepted in a request body or route.**

### Auth behaviour

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| Missing or malformed `Authorization` header | `401 Unauthorized` |
| Key does not resolve to an active brain | `401 Unauthorized` |
| Resource belongs to a different brain | `404 Not Found` (never `403`) |

Cross-tenant access always reads as not found — the existence of another brain's resources is never revealed.

---

## Brain identity

### `GET /brain`

Returns the public header metadata for the brain resolved from the API key. Harness callers use this to confirm which instance they are talking to. Brains have no schema/deploy version stamp — versioning is per-resource on the Management API.

Response `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "id": "3f0c...",
  "instanceName": "salesmate",
  "name": "Salesmate",
  "description": "Sales coaching brain",
  "status": "Active",
  "embeddingModel": "voyage-3-lite",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-09T07:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-09T07:00:00Z"
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | Brain GUID |
| `instanceName` | Organisation-scoped DNS slug |
| `name` | Display name |
| `description` | Optional |
| `status` | `Active` when authenticated |
| `embeddingModel` | From deploy; may be null on older brains |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | Timestamps |

Does **not** return the API key or organisation id.

## Conventions

- **Base URL** — all paths are relative to the brain service host.
- **Content type** — request and response bodies are JSON (`application/json`), except the sync run endpoint which streams `text/event-stream`, and `POST /transcription` which accepts `multipart/form-data` (see BRA410).
- **Tenancy** — implicit; derived from the API key.
- **Codes vs IDs** — entity types and unit-of-work types are referenced by their stable deploy **code**; instances are referenced by their **id** (GUID).
- **Errors** — failures return `{ "error": "message" }` with an appropriate status code.

### Common status codes

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Successful read or idempotent action |
| `201 Created` | Resource created |
| `202 Accepted` | Async run queued |
| `400 Bad Request` | Missing/invalid field, or unknown type code |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `404 Not Found` | Resource not found within the brain's scope |
