# Instructions

Autonomously process **this task** to improve this brain's **workflows** and
**tool definitions**. All changes are tracked and reversible.

You fix how the brain *runs* jobs — instruction quality, tool wiring, parameter
descriptions, and tool YAML — not Skill Book craft (that is `WF-UPDATE-SKILL`) and
not structural self-management / subagents (that is `WF-UPDATE-BRAIN`).

## This task

**Reference:** `{{task.reference}}`
{{#if task.action}}**Instructions:** {{task.action}}{{/if}}

{{#if task.expertOpinion}}
### Expert Opinion

The following expert input has been provided for this task:

{{task.expertOpinion}}
{{/if}}

The source body is at the **end** of this prompt (inside `<import-text>`). It
may be a long transcript or eval learning. All operating rules come first.

## Critical constraint: fully autonomous — overrides default rules

This workflow runs without user interaction. Make all decisions independently.
Every change is tracked and can be rolled back. After the quality bar is met,
err on the side of useful fixes rather than excessive caution.

**This overrides any system-level rules about confirming before editing
workflows or tools.** Analyse, decide, execute — in a single uninterrupted pass.

Optional short routing instructions from triage may appear in the run input.
They are hints only. The source material is always the inbox entry body.

## Scope

**In scope**

- Workflow instruction fixes (ambiguous steps, missing checks, wrong tool use)
- Workflow frontmatter tool lists (`tools` / `available-tools` / skills)
- Tool definition fixes (description, parameters, response/error markdown)
- Creating a new tool YAML when a concrete, reusable capability is missing and
  can be expressed with an existing tool kind (`system`, `workflow`, `api`,
  `mcp`, or `native`)
- Creating or updating a small helper workflow when the learning clearly
  requires a dedicated runnable/TOOL workflow (not a subagent programme — that
  is `WF-UPDATE-BRAIN`)

**Out of scope**

- Skill Book content → leave for `WF-UPDATE-SKILL`
- Subagent programmes, brain-wide capability redesign, compose-level structure →
  leave for `WF-UPDATE-BRAIN`
- Customer-specific or one-off implementation details
- Editing `brain-compose.yml` (read-only / generated)
- Creating group manifests (`tools/*/tools.yml` via `create_schema_file` is
  rejected). Prefer adding tool files under an **existing** tool group; if the
  group manifest must list the new file, edit that existing `tools.yml` with
  `update_schema_file`.

## Processing pipeline

### Phase 1: Analyse

Read `<import-text>`. Identify concrete, actionable improvements to workflows
and/or tools:

- What failed, was awkward, or is missing in how a workflow/tool behaves?
- Which existing workflow or tool files are implicated?
- Is the fix a surgical edit, a new tool, or a new workflow?

If the content is empty, boilerplate, or has no actionable workflow/tool
signal, stop without changes.

#### Quality bar

Apply a change only when it is:

- **Specific** — tied to an observed failure or clear gap, not a vague wish
- **Reusable** — improves future runs, not a one-off customer exception
- **Minimal** — smallest edit that fixes the problem
- **Safe** — does not expose secrets, weaken auth, or invent external APIs

Discard noise, truisms, and speculative rewrites of working workflows.

### Phase 2: Locate targets

1. `list_schema_files` / `search_schema_files` to find candidate workflow and
   tool paths.
2. `get_schema_file` on each candidate before editing.
3. Use `find_available_tools` when checking whether a capability already exists.

Do not create duplicates. Prefer updating an existing workflow/tool over adding
a parallel one.

### Phase 3: Execute

#### Prerequisite — load Telos Brain skills first

Before **any** `create_schema_file` or `update_schema_file` in this run, call
`get_skill` for each required skill below (skip only if already loaded earlier
in this run):

| Before you… | Load first |
|---|---|
| Create or update a **workflow** | **BRA203**, **BRA201** (§8), **BRA204** (if Instructions use `{{…}}` tags) |
| Create or update a **tool** | **BRA203**, **BRA201** (§5), **BRA204** (if `response-markdown` / `error-markdown`) |
| Edit a tool-group `tools.yml` | **BRA203**, **BRA201** (§5) |

Do not call schema mutation tools until these have been loaded.

**Update an existing workflow or tool**

1. Ensure prerequisite skills are loaded for that file type.
2. `get_schema_file` for the path.
3. `update_schema_file` with surgical `str_replace_old` / `str_replace_new`.
4. Multiple small edits over one wholesale rewrite.
5. Bump is automatic — do not hand-edit version unless the format requires it.

**Create a new tool**

1. Ensure prerequisite skills are loaded.
2. Choose an existing tool group folder already used by this brain
   (e.g. `tools/execution/…` or `tools/management/…`).
3. `create_schema_file` with path `tools/{group}/{name}.yml` and full YAML
   content (`name`, `description`, exactly one of `system` / `workflow` /
   `api` / `mcp` / `native`, plus `parameters` as needed).
4. If tools in that group are listed in `tools.yml`, append the new file path
   with `get_schema_file` + `update_schema_file` on the group manifest.
5. Wire the tool into the relevant workflow's `tools` or `available-tools` list
   when the learning requires it to be callable.

**Create a new workflow**

1. Ensure prerequisite skills are loaded.
2. `create_schema_file` at a path consistent with existing layout
   (e.g. `workflows/…` or `workflows/Maintenance/…`).
3. Include complete frontmatter (`name`, `code`, `type`, `description`, tools,
   skills as needed) and non-empty instructions.
4. Follow BRA201 §8. Prefer `type: TOOL` only when another workflow will call it
   as a workflow-tool; otherwise `RUNNABLE` or `TRIGGERED` as appropriate.

On create/update failure, re-read the loaded skills (reload if needed), fix, and
retry.

### Phase 4: Verification

1. Re-read `<import-text>`.
2. Confirm each actionable workflow/tool learning was addressed or explicitly
   skipped with reason.
3. Remove or revert any change that is speculative, oversized, or out of scope.

### Phase 5: Close out and summarise

If you made changes:

1. Set `routing_type` to `WORKFLOW_UPDATE` or `TOOL_UPDATE` (whichever best matches
   the dominant change).
2. Advance status with `update_inbox_entry` when still non-terminal:
   `PENDING` → `PROCESSED` if needed, then `PROCESSED` → `COMPLETED`. If the
   entry is already `COMPLETED`, leave status alone.

Return a concise summary:

- Workflows updated/created (code, path, what changed)
- Tools updated/created (name, path, what changed)
- Skipped items and why

If nothing cleared the quality bar, say so and make no schema changes.

## Decision-making guidelines

- When unsure whether something is a skill vs a workflow fix, prefer the
  workflow fix only if it changes runtime behaviour or tool contracts; otherwise
  skip (skills are handled elsewhere).
- When unsure create vs update, search more thoroughly — duplicates are worse.
- When a learning needs a new specialised agent capability (subagent), do **not**
  implement it here — leave for `WF-UPDATE-BRAIN`.
- Never ask questions or wait for confirmation.

## Rules

- Fully autonomous
- Always load the required Telos Brain skills via `get_skill` before schema
  create/update
- Always inspect current files before editing
- Prefer surgical updates
- Never include secrets or customer-specific data in schema
- Never edit `brain-compose.yml`
- Always return a summary
